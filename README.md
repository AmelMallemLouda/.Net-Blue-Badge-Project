 - As A User (VS/Postman)
	 - Once the application is on your local machine you should be able to run it in Visual Studio which will open a browser to display the running server and its associated parts.
	 - After the webpage loads and no errors are seen you can open Postman to start interacting with the information already in the application or add you own.
		 - To do this you must copy the web address from the browser window that opened up and use the /api/Hotel, /api/Review, /api/Transaction, /api/Customer, or /api/VacPac after the web address to modify or create an entry in each respective table. (ex https://localhost:XXXXX/api/Hotel)
			 - Following that you can select either:
				 - GET (Views already created data)
				 - POST (Creates new data)
				 - PUT (Edits data)
				 - DELETE (Removes data)
**To target specific entries you must input the corresponding ID for the selected information** 
-ex  https://localhost:XXXXX/api/Hotel/(id)
